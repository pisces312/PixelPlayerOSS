/**
 * Turns a [SerendipityContext] into the sentence handed to the playlist generator.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: `(context, variant)` always produces the same text, which is what makes
 * "reshuffle" verifiable in unit tests. [variant] is the only source of variation, so the caller
 * owns the randomness and the tests can pin it.
 *
 * The sentence is always English. The playlist pipeline already speaks English end to end (system
 * prompt, `'Title - Artist'` output format), and keeping the prompt in one language avoids mixing
 * scripts inside a single request. The sheet shows localized chips next to it instead.
