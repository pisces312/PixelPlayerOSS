/**
 * Drives the "car lyric title" feature: instead of the track title, session consumers (Bluetooth
 * AVRCP stack, notification, SMTC) see the lyric line matching the playback position, which is how
 * head units that can only render Title/Artist end up scrolling lyrics.
 *
 * The override is published through [LyricTitlePlayer], which fakes a metadata-changed event
 * rather than mutating the playlist; see that class for why.
 *
 * **Segments.** A head unit renders only a fixed width of title, so a line wider than
 * [MAX_COLUMNS_PER_CUE] is published in several slices spread evenly over that line's own
 * duration, capped at 4 s apart so a gap or the track tail cannot push a slice into silence;
 * [buildLyricCues] does the cutting, and it measures width rather than characters — the
 * same field that fits ten Chinese characters fits thirty letters. Users whose head unit scrolls
 * long titles itself can turn the cutting off entirely, in which case every line goes out whole
 * and the unit does the scrolling.
 *
 * Scheduling, publishing and the de-duplication key all work on slices, so read "cue" below where
 * an earlier revision of this class read "line".
 *
 * **Lead.** Every cue is published `leadMs` *before* its timestamp, because the path from
 * [LyricTitlePlayer.publishMetadataOverride] to pixels on the head unit costs a few hundred
 * milliseconds (AVRCP round trip plus the unit redrawing), and a title that changes exactly on the
 * beat reads as late. The value comes from the "title lead" setting — it describes the car rather
 * than the song, so it is one value for the whole track and deliberately never a per-cue value: a
 * uniform shift leaves the interval between cues exactly as the lyrics define it, so the error
 * stays constant instead of accumulating. The one visible cost is that each cue also *ends* that
 * much earlier — unavoidable while the whole state is a single Title field.
 *
 * **Scheduling.** Media3 exposes no position callback, so the active cue has to be sampled. Rather
 * than sampling on a fixed interval, this controller sleeps until the *next cue* —
 * `delay = min(nextCue - position, WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_MS) / speed` — and recomputes from the live
 * position after every wake-up, so inaccuracy cannot accumulate. That is roughly one wake-up per
 * published cue instead of two per second, and **no** wake-up at all while paused, disabled, or
 * without synced lyrics. The watchdog cap is the self-healing fallback a fixed poll gets for free:
 * if an event we depend on never arrives, the title still catches up within
 * [WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_MS]. Buffering is the one case that takes the cap as-is — the position is
 * frozen, so there is no residual to derive and the interval is simply waited out again.
 *
 * Player events (seek, play/pause, track change, speed change, load completion) all just [signal] a
 * recompute through [Player.Listener.onEvents]; the service signals too for Bluetooth device
 * changes and for a MediaSession player replacement.
 *
 * Everything is gated — the real track title is kept unless all of these hold:
 * 1. the `car lyric title` toggle is on,
 * 2. the current output is a Bluetooth A2DP device,
 * 3. a song is loaded and it has synced lyrics.
 *
 * Condition 2 exists because the override is visible to *every* MediaSession consumer, not just the
 * head unit: the notification and the lock screen read the same metadata. Without it, staring at
 * the phone with wired headphones would also show a lyric line where the song title belongs.
 *
 * Note on "does the head unit support it": there is no public API to query the peer's AVRCP
 * version, and there does not need to be — a unit that cannot render metadata simply never issues
 * `GetElementAttributes`. The override is harmless in that case.
