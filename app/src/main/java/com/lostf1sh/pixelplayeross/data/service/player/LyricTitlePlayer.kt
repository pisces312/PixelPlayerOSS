/**
 * Outermost session-facing player wrapper that lets the service replace the outgoing media
 * metadata (typically the title) without touching the inner player's playlist.
 *
 * Media3's [androidx.media3.session.MediaSession] caches metadata from
 * `Player.Listener.onMediaMetadataChanged` and pushes it to the legacy session stub, which is
 * exactly the channel the Bluetooth AVRCP stack reads (see `MediaSessionImpl.onMediaMetadataChanged`).
 * Overriding [getMediaMetadata] alone is therefore not enough: external consumers only refresh
 * when that listener callback fires. The only supported way to produce the callback through the
 * inner player is `replaceMediaItem`/`setMediaItem`, which also emits `onMediaItemTransition`
 * and triggers unrelated side effects (listening-stats sync, scrobble, snapshot persistence).
 *
 * This wrapper keeps its own reference to every registered listener so it can dispatch
 * `onMediaMetadataChanged` directly, giving session consumers a metadata update with zero
 * playlist mutation on the inner player.
 *
 * While an override is published this wrapper also **withdraws [Player.COMMAND_GET_TIMELINE]**.
 * The Bluetooth AVRCP stack refuses to forward a metadata update while the playing queue does not
 * agree with it, and retries two seconds later — a title that changes every line therefore never
 * reaches the head unit. With the command withdrawn, Media3 reports no active queue item
 * (`MediaSessionLegacyStub`), which is one of that gate's documented short-circuits, so every
 * override is forwarded immediately. See `docs/car-lyrics-avrcp-gate.md`.
 *
 * Listeners registered through [addListener] are still forwarded to the inner player, so all
 * other events behave exactly as before.
