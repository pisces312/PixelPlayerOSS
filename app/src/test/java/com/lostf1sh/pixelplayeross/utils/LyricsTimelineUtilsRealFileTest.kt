/**
 * The blank-marker rule at the scale of a real lyrics file, driven through the real parser.
 *
 * The hand-made fixtures in [LyricsTimelineUtilsTest] prove the rule one case at a time; this one
 * proves it survives a file that was written by whoever produced the track. Its shape comes from a
 * 4:25 song whose LRC carries 105 lines, **44** of them markers: `lyrics/blank-marker-shape.lrc`
 * keeps that file's timestamps and, line for line, its width in title columns, with the words
 * replaced by filler. Words are what a suite must not check in, and they are also the one thing
 * this rule never looks at — the timeline follows timestamps, marker positions and column widths,
 * which the fixture reproduces exactly, so every cue below falls on the millisecond it falls on in
 * the song. Regenerating it is described in `docs/car-lyrics-blank-markers.md` §6.
 *
 * The numbers asserted here are the ones the emulator run measured (`loaded 105 synced lines as
 * 89 cues`, the title handed back at cue 9 / 28 / 51), so a regression that would take four
 * minutes and a debug build to catch on a device fails here in milliseconds.
